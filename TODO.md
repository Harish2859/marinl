# Fix Asset Loading Error

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Identified the issue: File extension mismatch (.png vs .jpg)
- [x] Updated `lib/auth_page.dart` to reference `login_background.jpg` instead of `login_background.png`
- [x] Verified assets are properly declared in `pubspec.yaml`

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the app to confirm the asset loads correctly
- [ ] Run `flutter pub get` if needed to ensure dependencies are up to date
